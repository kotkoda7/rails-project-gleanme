How to do 
Locations - index
user/locations - index?

Nested forms for Location (allow nested attr for) - OR User index

Update user#index form and controller action

If want to sign up but already have an account with same username >> need error message!

Error should be on the TOP and possibly different color!

users/show page MY LOCATIONS!
User name and list of locations (not detailed) for particular user

locations/show page
detail of certain location
can edit only if current_user!
