Do I need (edible) categories in order to satisfy requirement for join table and user able to submit other than foreign key? 
I MAY
Might be ok 
- address of locations for certain edible
- name of edibles for certain location



Isssues:
- If logged in already and user goes in menu to log in or sign up:
flash notice: you are already logged in and redirect_to root.
- with _form loc_types don't show up.

- http://localhost:3000/users/3/locations not working

user_location_path:
/users/:user_id/locations

VS
locations_path
/locations

---------
Header/navigation
<%= link_to "Edit this Location", edit_user_location_path(current_user)%>
---------
SESSIONS
- new -> log in

USERS 
- new -> sign up
- index -> aka user's entered locations (list of) with link to show pages
- show -> aka user's specific location (with edibles and categories etc)


LOCATIONS
- index -> list of ALL locations in database
- show -> details of a location 
- new -> add a new location (aka user's location), must be logged in to do that
- edit -> user's specific entered location (with edibles and categories etc)
NO EDIT OR DELETE for other's locations allowed

EDIBLES
- user should be able to add an edible and choose or add a category (for edible)
   -> should this be done through the views/locations/new page OR here?
- edit edible name (if misspelled etc)

EDIBLE_CATEGORIES
- should be able to add a new category, but only if an edible is added
- dropdown of (existing) categories to add to new edible

----------------

Nested routes:
- users and locations
paths: 
locations (index)
locations/:id 

users/:id/locations (index)

users/:id/locations/:id (show, edit, update and new, create)

Nested form (via join table):
- Locations
- Edibles
- Edible categories

----------------
Nested forms for Location (allow nested attr for) - OR User index

Update user#index form and controller action

If want to sign up but already have an account with same username >> need error message!

Error should be on the TOP and possibly different color!

users/show page MY LOCATIONS!
User name and list of locations (not detailed) for particular user

locations/show page
detail of certain location
can edit only if current_user!

NEED ERROR message if username already exist -> can't sign up or log in


- Allow to add category - yes only if adding edible
